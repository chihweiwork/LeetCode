```python
# https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/
#
# Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
#
# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
#
# Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        jumps = 0
        cur_end = 0
        farthest = 0
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])
            if i == cur_end:
                jumps += 1
                cur_end = farthest
